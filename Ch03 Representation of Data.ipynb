    "numbers. On modern computers, all non-integer real numbers are\n",
    "represented using the floating point data type. \n",
    "\n",
    "Almost all processors have adopted the *IEEE 754 binary floating point\n",
    "standard* for binary representation of floating point numbers. The\n",
    "standard allocates 32 bits for the representation, although there is a\n",

    "\n",
    "Python provides the following representations for numbers:\n",
    "  * **Integers:** You can use integers as you are used to from your math\n",
    "     classes. Interestingly, Python adopts a seamless internal\n",
    "     representation so that integers can effectively have any number of\n",
    "     digits. The internal mechanism of Python switches from the\n",
    "     CPU-imposed fixed-size integers to some elaborated large-integer\n",
    "     representation silently when needed. You do not have to worry about\n",
    "     it. Furthermore, keep in mind that “73.” is **not** an integer in\n",
    "     Python. It is a floating point number (73.0). An integer cannot have\n",
    "     a decimal point as part of it.\n",
    "     \n",
    "  * **Floating point numbers (float in short):** In Python, numbers with decimal points are taken and represented as floating-point\n",
    "     numbers. For example, 1.45, 0.26, and -99.0 are float but 102 and -8\n",
    "     are not. We can also use the scientific notation\n",
    "     ($a \\times 10^b$) to write floating point numbers. For example,\n",
    "     float 0.0000000436 can be written in scientific notation as\n",
    "$4.36 \\times 10^{-8}$ and in Python as 4.36E-8 or 4.36e-8.\n",
    "     \n",
    "  * **Complex numbers:** In Python, complex numbers can be specified\n",
    "     using `j` after a floating point number (or integer) to denote the\n",
    "     imaginary part: e.g., `1.5-2.6j` for the complex number\n",
    "$(1.5+2.6i)$. The `j` symbol (or $i$) represents\n",
    "$\\sqrt{-1}$. There are other ways to signify complex numbers,\n",
    "     but this is the most natural way considering your previous knowledge\n",
    "     from high school.\n",

    "## 3.4 Representing Truth Values (Booleans)\n",
    "<span id=\"chapters_ch3_data_representation_representing_truth_values_booleans\"> </span>\n",
    "*Boolean* is another data type that has roots in the very structure of\n",
    "the CPU. The answers to all questions asked to the CPU are either *true* or\n",
    "*false*. The logic of a CPU is strictly based on the binary evaluation\n",
    "system. This logic system is coined as *Boolean logic*. It was\n",
    "introduced by George Boole in his book “The Mathematical Analysis of\n",
    "Logic” (1847).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is tightly connected to the concepts of binary `0` and `1`: In all\n",

    "and pictures. We leave the processing of sound and images out of the scope of this book. However, text is something we have to study.\n",

    "### 3.5.1 Characters\n",
    "<span id=\"chapters_ch3_data_representation_characters\"> </span>\n",
    "\n",
    "Written natural languages consist of basic units called *graphemes*.\n",
    "Alphabetic letters, Chinese-Japanese-Korean characters, punctuation\n",
    "marks, and numeric digits are all graphemes. There are also some basic\n",
    "actions that commonly go hand in hand with textual data entry. “Make\n",
    "newline”, “Make a beep sound”, “Tab”, “Enter” are some examples. These\n",
    "are called “unprintables”.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we represent graphemes and unprintables in binary? Graphemes are\n",
    "highly culture dependent. The shapes do not have a numerical\n",
    "foundation. As far as computer science is concerned, the only way to\n",
    "represent such information in numbers is to make a table and build this\n",
    "table into electronic input/output devices. Such a table will have two\n",
    "columns: The graphemes and unprintables in one column and the assigned\n",
    "binary code in the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the history of computers, there have been several such tables,\n",
    "mainly constructed by computer manufacturers. In time, most of them\n",
    "vanished and only one survived: The *ASCII* (American Standard Code for\n",
    "Information Interchange) table which was developed by the American\n",
    "National Standards Institute (ANSI). This American code, developed by\n",
    "Americans, is naturally quite “American“. It incorporates all characters\n",
    "of the American-English alphabet, including, for example, the dollar\n",
    "sign, but stops there. The table does not contain a single character\n",
    "from another culture (for example, even the pound sign ‘£’ is not in the\n",
    "table).\n",
    "\n",
    "The ASCII table has 128 lines. It maps 128 American graphemes and\n",
    "unprintables to 7-bit-long (not 8-bit-long!) codes. Since the 7-bit long code can also be interpreted as a number, for convenience, this number is also\n",
