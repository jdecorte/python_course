        "interfaces by accessing public data and actions. This can be considered\n",
        "as a message-passing mechanism: Object1 calls Object2’s action f(), which\n",

        "  1. Define a class `Vec3d` to represent 3 dimensional vectors. `Vec3d` should encapsulate 3 float values, `x`, `y`, and `z`. You should implement the following methods for your class:\n",
        "     * `__init__(self, x,y,z)`: The constructor, which gets 3 values and construct a 3D vector. \n",
        "     * `__str__(self)`: Returns the string representation of vector as `(x, y, z)` so that `print()` and `str()` functions can display the vector in        a human-readable form.\n",
        "     * `add(self, b)`: Constructs and returns a new `Vec3d` object which is the addition of the current object and `b` which is another `Vec3d`           object. Vector addition is defined as the addition of all corresponding dimensions. \n",
        "     * `len(self)`: Returns length (norm) of the vector as a scalar: $\\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}$.\n",
        "     * `norm(self)`: Construct and return a vector in the same direction but the length is `1.0`. Simply divide all dimensions by the length         of the vector. \n",
