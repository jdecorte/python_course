        "Python provides the following representations for numbers (the following\n",

        "  * **Integers:** You can use integers as you are used to from your math\n",
        "     classes. Interestingly, Python adopts a seamless internal\n",
        "     representation so that integers can effectively have any number of\n",

        "     representation  when needed. You do not have to worry about\n",

        "     a decimal point as part of it.\n",

        "  * **Floating point numbers (float in short):** In Python, numbers that have a decimal point are taken and represented as floating point\n",
        "     numbers. For example, 1.45, 0.26, and -99.0 are float but 102 and -8\n",
        "     are not. We can also use the scientific notation\n",
        "     ($a \\times 10^b$) to write floating point numbers. For example,\n",
        "     float 0.0000000436 can be written in scientific notation as $4.36 \\times 10^{-8}$ and in Python as 4.36E-8 or 4.36e-8.\n",
        "     \n",
        "  * **Complex numbers:** In Python, complex numbers can be created by\n",

        "     imaginary part: e.g., `1.5-2.6j` for the complex number $(1.5-2.6i)$. The `j` symbol (or $i$) represents $\\sqrt{-1}$. There are other ways to create complex numbers,\n",

Each bit of the two’s complement representation of an integer value takes part in a logical operation with the same bit position of the other operand. `&` denotes the logical `and`, `|` denotes the logical `or`, and unary operator `~` denotes the logical `not`. Exclusive or, `^` has no Boolean counterpart. It gives 0 for the case where both values are the same, 1 otherwise. In addition to the binary logical operators, there are *left shift* (`<<`) and *right shift* (`>>`) operators that shift all bits to the left or right and pad 0 for the missing values. The right operand for a shift operator is an integer denoting how many times the bits will be shifted.\n",
