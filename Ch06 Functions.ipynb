        "\n",
        "There are four main reasons for using functions while solving world problems with a programming language:\n",
        "\n",
        " 1. **Reusability**  \n",
        "  A function is defined at a single point in a program, but it can be\n",
        "  called from several different points. To better illustrate this, let us consider an example: Assume that you need to calculate the\n",
        "  run-length encoding of a string (the example code from Section 5.2.4) in your program for $n$ different strings in different\n",
        "  positions in your code. In a programming language without functions, you\n",
        "  would have to copy-paste that run-length encoding code piece in $n$ different places.\n",
        "  Thanks to functions, we can place the code piece in a function once\n",
        "  (named `encodeRunLen` for example) and use it in $n$ places via\n",
        "  simple function calls like `enc = encodeRunLen(inpstr)`.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " 2. **Maintenance**  \n",
        "  Using functions makes it easier to make updates to an algorithm. Let us\n",
        "  explain this with the run-length encoding example: Assume that we found\n",
        "  an error in our calculation or that we discovered a better algorithm than\n",
        "  the one we are using. Without functions, you would need to go through\n",
        "  all your code, find the locations where your run-length encoding\n",
        "  algorithm is implemented, and update each and every one of them. This is very\n",
        "  impractical and tedious. With functions, it is sufficient just to change the function that implements the run-length encoding.\n",
        "\n",
        " 3. **Structuredness**  \n",
        "    Let us have a look at a perfectly valid Python expression:  \n",
        "    ```python\n",
        "    (b if b<c else c) if (a if a<b else b)<(b if b<c else c) else (a if a<b else b)\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "      \n",
        "    which certainly takes some time for a human to parse and understand but it just performs the following:  \n",
        "    ```python\n",
        "    max(min(a,b), min(b,c))\n",
        "    ```  \n",
        "\n",
        "    The version with the `min` and `max` functions has a structure that is easier to parse and follow. This in turn makes the code more     readable: Even if the definitions of `max` and `min` are not given yet, one can still grasp what the expression is up to. It is not only   because the expression is smaller, but because function names can give clues about the purposes of the actions.\n",

        "## 6.2 Defining Functions\n",
        "<span id=\"chapters_ch6_functions_defining_functions\"> </span>\n",
        "\n",
        "For defining a function, Python adopts the following syntax:\n",

        "```python\n",
        "def FunctionName(Paramter_1, Parameter_2, ...):\n",

        "sent to the function at the call-time. If the function is going to give a resulting \n",
        "value in return to the call, this value is provided by a `return`\n",
        "statement.\n",
        "\n",
        "**FunctionName** is the name of the function being\n",
        "defined. Python follows the same naming rules and conventions used for\n",

        "back and check the restrictions for naming variables in Section 4.4.3.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here is a straightforward example. Let us assume that we want to\n",
        "implement the following mathematical function:\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\begin{split}F_{gravity}(m_1,m_2,r) = G\\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}.\\end{split}\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This function, `F_gravity()`, returns a value (i.e., the result of `G * m_1 * m_2 / (r * r)`). This is achieved with the\n",

        "$m_2$ and $r$ are provided as the first, second and \n",
