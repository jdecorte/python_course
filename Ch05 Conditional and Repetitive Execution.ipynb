    "Many circumstances require a program’s execution (i) to change its flow based on the truth value of a condition, or (ii) to repeat a set of steps for a certain number of times or until a condition is no longer true. \n",
    "These two kinds of actions are crucial components of programming solutions, for which Python provides several alternatives. As we will see in this chapter, some of these alternatives are compound statements while others are expressions.\n",

    "\n",
    "Asking (mostly) mathematical questions that have Boolean-type answers\n",
    "and taking some actions (or not) based on the Boolean answers are\n",
    "fundamental in designing algorithms. This is so vital that there is no\n",

    "### 5.1.1 The `if` Statement\n",
    "<span id=\"chapters_ch5_conditional_and_repetitive_if_statement\"> </span>\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax of the conditional (`if`) statement is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "`if` $\\boxed{\\color{red}{Boolean\\;expression\\;}}$ `:` $\\boxed{\\color{red}{Statement\\;}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The semantics is rather straightforward: If the\n",
    "$\\color{red}{Boolean\\;expression}$ evaluates to `True`, then the\n",
    "$\\color{red}{Statement}$ is carried out; otherwise, the \n",
    "$\\color{red}{Statement}$ is not executed. Here is a simple example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> if 5 > 2: print(\"Hurray\")\n",
    "Hurray\n",
    ">>> if 2 > 5: print(\"No I will not believe that!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We observe that the Boolean expression in the last example evaluates to\n",
    "`False` and hence the statement with the\n",
    "`print()` function is not carried\n",
    "out.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to group statements?**  \n",
    "It is quite often that we want to do more than one action instead of\n",
    "executing a single statement. This can be performed in Python as follows:\n",
    "  *  Switch to a new line,\n",
    "     indent by one tab, \n",
    "     write your first statement to be executed,       \n",
    "  *  Switch to the next line,\n",
    "*indent* by the same amount (usually your Python-aware editor will do it\n",
    "     for you), write your second statement to be executed, and     \n",
    "  *  Continue doing these as many times as necessary.     \n",
    "  *  To finish this writing task, and presumably enter a statement which\n",
    "     is *not* part of the group action, just do not indent.\n",
    "     \n",
    "\n",
    "It is very important that these statements that are part of the `if` \n",
    "part (statements after the colon) have the same amount and type of whitespace for indentation. For example, if the first\n",
    "statement has 4 spaces, all following statements in the if statement\n",
    "need to start with 4 spaces. If the first indentation is a tab character, all the following\n",
    "statements in the if statement need to start with a tab character. Since\n",
    "these whitespaces are not visible, it is very easy to make mistakes and\n",
    "get annoying errors from the interpreter. To avoid this, we strongly\n",
    "recommend you choose a style of indentation (e.g., either 4 whitespaces or a\n",
    "single tab) and stick to it as a programming style.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> if 5 > 2:\n",
    "...     print(7*6)\n",
    "...     print(\"Hurray\")\n",
    "...     x = 6\n",
    "42\n",
    "Hurray\n",
    ">>> print(x)\n",
    "6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The “`>>>`” as well as the “`...`” prompts appear when you sit in front of\n",
    "the interpreter. They will not show up if you run your programs from a file. If you type in these small\n",
    "programs (we call them *snippets*) just ignore “`>>>`” and “`...`”\n",
